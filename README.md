For the JavaScript Frameworks course assignment, we were to make a website with a login functionality with WordPress CMS REST API.

## Description

In this project, we were to make a website with what we had learned in the last few weeks. This website needed to include the following:

- Home - Show a list of items from an API of our choice. I used one I made from WordPress.
- Detail page - Here, we needed to show at least three properties from each item.
- Contact - A contact form with validations.
- Login - A login form where you can make a login request to a WordPress API with the JWT plugin
- Admin page - This will show up when you have successfully logged in
