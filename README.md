For the JavaScript Frameworks course assignment we were to make a website with a login functionality with WordPress CMS REST API.

## Description

In this project we were to make a website with what we had learned the last few weeks. This website needed to include:

- Home - Show a list of items from an API of our choice. I used one I made from WordPress.
- Detail page - Here we needed to show at least 3 properties from each item.
- Contact - A contact form with validations.
- Login - A login form where you can make a login rewuest to a Wordpress API with the JWT plugin
- Admin page - This will show up when you have successfully logged in
